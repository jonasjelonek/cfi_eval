## Questions, hints, general interest

Of course, you can always contact me if you have any questions or hints regarding this tool or in general my bachelor thesis. You can find my contact information in my profile.
All hints and questions regarding the purpose of this tool and its implementation, or regarding my bachelor thesis are welcome. The same applies to the Rust code, as I am still learning heavily writing code in Rust at the time of writing this.
